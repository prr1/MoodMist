## Architecture Overview

### Mood Analysis Engine
The core of MoodTunes is its sophisticated mood analysis system:

```typescript
// Analyzes multiple data sources
const moodData = MoodAnalyzer.analyzeMood(
  weatherData,      // Current weather conditions
  calendarEvents,   // Upcoming schedule
  socialPosts       // Recent social media activity
);
```

### Music Matching Algorithm
Songs are matched based on audio features:
- **Valence**: Musical positivity (happiness/sadness)
- **Energy**: Intensity and power of the track
- **Danceability**: How suitable for dancing
- **Tempo**: Speed of the music
- **Acousticness**: Amount of acoustic vs electronic elements

### Real-time Updates
The application provides live updates as conditions change:
- Weather changes trigger new recommendations
